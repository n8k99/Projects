# Observations

Running notes on what the Rosetta Stone reveals about language design, paradigm boundaries, and what InnateScript is and isn't.

## G001 — Find PI to the Nth Digit

**Not everything is a choreography.**

PI computation is pure math. It doesn't coordinate agents. It doesn't verify output against reality. It doesn't need concurrent execution or fulfillment fallbacks. A single function in any language computes it faster and more correctly than any choreography could.

InnateScript expresses this as `@pi{digits: N}` — a resolver-provided native. The evaluator's host language (Common Lisp) provides the implementation. The choreographic language doesn't compute PI. It knows how to *use* PI in a coordination context.

This is the first boundary: InnateScript is a coordination language. Problems that require no coordination resolve natively through the evaluator.

**The evaluator's host language is the resolver's native library.** If the evaluator is Common Lisp, `@pi{digits: N}` bottoms out in Lisp. If the evaluator were Lean, the same reference would bottom out in a proven-correct function. Same choreography, different guarantees. The language is agnostic to its own substrate.

## G002 — Fibonacci Sequence

**InnateScript coordinates interpretation, not computation.**

Computation already has languages. Every language in this repo can compute Fibonacci. What no language before InnateScript can express is: "Kathryn maps this sequence to revenue targets, Sanjay validates it against historical data, Eliana checks they're both grounded, and the `where` scores whether the combined interpretation actually reflects growth trajectory rather than wishful scaling."

The agents don't compute. They *interpret*. The choreography coordinates interpretation. That's the gap in every existing language — not "how do I calculate this" but "how do I get three perspectives on a calculation to converge into something I can trust."

Pure computation resolves natively: `@fib{n: 20}`. The choreography emerges when agents need to coordinate *around* the result. The sequence is a function call. The interpretation is a dance.

## G003 — Prime Factorization

**Math and choreography share vocabulary.**

Factorization decomposes a whole into its irreducible parts. Choreographic projection decomposes a global intention into each agent's irreducible local slice. The structure is the same — break something into pieces that can't be broken further, then work with the pieces independently.

The `where` for a factorization-based choreography echoes the fundamental theorem of arithmetic: the decomposition is unique and the product of the factors reconstructs the original. Applied to coordination: did the agents' assignments cover every irreducible piece, and do the pieces multiply back into the whole?

Three projects in. Pure computation still resolves natively. But this is the first time the *shape* of a computation mirrors a coordination concept. Decomposition into irreducibles is what both prime factorization and choreographic projection do. The Rosetta Stone is starting to show where math and orchestration share structure.

## G004 — Next Prime Number

**Streams don't finish.**

Every project so far produces a result and stops. A prime generator produces *endlessly* — values on demand, no termination. That's a different shape, and InnateScript's coordination primitives assume things finish. `concurrent` runs, `join` waits, `where` scores the outcome. But a generator has no outcome. It has a *flow*.

`until` might handle this: `@primes until 100 found`. The spec says "time-bounded or condition-bounded waiting." A count is a condition. But the syntax hasn't been tested against a stream — it's been used for bounding an agent's obligation or a choreographic context, not for bounding an infinite producer.

This is the first time the Rosetta Stone asks a question the spec doesn't clearly answer. Four projects in and the language is already being stress-tested by a basic programming concept: the infinite iterator.
